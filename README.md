## Bloccit: a Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails.

  This is my Bloccit app that I completed during the Foundations lessons at Bloc with Ruby on Rails. It is a clone of Reddit and therefore not especially useful since it's essentially a social network with no users.

  However, it did teach me several fundamental lessons in programming, including how to:

  * interact with Github branches
  * test different aspects of a Rails project with RSpec
  * interact with models, views, controllers, and databases
  * implement Ruby gems in a project

  The master branch is of course the "shipped" version of Bloccit, and the Assignment branches are my own coursework that I built without direct guidance from Bloc's course.

  Bloccit features include the abilities to:

  * create a user account with a username, email, and password, and use a Gravatar for a profile picture
  * view a user account, which displays the user's Gravatar, posts, and comments
  * create topics, posts, and comments
  * favorite posts and track new comments on them
  * add labels to topics and posts
  * comment on a post and have it update the page without refreshing
  * edit and delete topics and posts, but only if you created them or are an admin
  * delete comments, but only if you created them or are an admin
  * create standard or admin users- but admins can only be created through the Bloccit API or if I add admins myself
  * solve world hunger, eliminate poverty, and become better looking!
